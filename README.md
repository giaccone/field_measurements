# field_measurements

## Introduction

This repository includes the magnetic flux density measured in front of a power transformer at 1386 regularly spaced points.

These data are used in a publication that is currently under review. 

* **Freschi F., Giaccone L., Cirimele V., Canova A., "Numerical assessment of low-frequency dosimetry from sampled magnetic fields"**

The authors submitted the paper for publication to the International journal *Physics in Medicine & Biology*. The paper has already obtained positive comments a the first review stage. The revision of the paper, according to the referees' comments, will be submitted again soon.

## Repository content

* `data_set.txt` : text file including the measurements. The file include a legend to understand the data meaning
* `plot_data.m`: for convenience of the MATLAB&reg; users, this script reads and visualises the data
